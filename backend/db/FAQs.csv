Why can’t I register for my classes?,"1) Have you been advised, and did your adviser clear you to register? All students must interact with their academic adviser each semester. Then, in order for the student to register, the adviser has to give ‘advising clearance’ in the SA system before the student can register.
2) Is it too soon for you to be registering? Students may register for classes for the next semester only after a certain date called their ‘registration appointment’. These dates can be found on the Registrar’s web site here: https://registrar.umbc.edu/calendars/registration-appointments/
Registration dates are based on earned credits (not total credits), and students with more earned credits go first.
3) Did you apply to graduate but not actually graduate? If you apply to graduate, you are automatically locked out of the registration system for future semesters. If you applied but did not graduate, you need to contact the Registrar’s Office and have them reactivate your account.

"Should I take COMP 101Y, CMSC 104, or CMSC 201?","COMP 101Y is a new course that is designed specifically for freshman computing majors (i.e., students considering or intending to major in CS, CE, IS, or the BTA program).  It provides a broad introduction to computational thinking, experience in programming, and instruction in core academic skills including time management, effective group work, and career planning.  CMSC 104 is a basic programming course that is primarily intended for non-computing majors.  CMSC 201 is a rigorous, fairly fast-paced introduction to programming skills that requires no prior programming experience but moves quickly and can be challenging for students who have not had much experience with computers and programming.  CMSC 201 also has a math prerequisite of MATH 150, so incoming students must have a MATH 151 placement or higher to take CMSC 201.

Therefore, if you are considering a computing major, have a MATH 151 or higher placement, and already have some programming experience or feel confident about the idea of learning a lot of programming very quickly, you should take CMSC 201.  If you are considering a computing major but do not have a MATH 151 or higher placement, or do not feel ready to enter a fast-paced, rigorous programming class, or simply aren’t quite sure about your major yet, you should take COMP 101Y.  If you are not intending a computing major and want a somewhat “gentler” programming introduction (or do not have a MATH 151 or higher placement), you should take CMSC 104.

If you are still not sure about which class to take, you may want to consult the “CMSC 104 Checklist” [https://www.csee.umbc.edu/undergraduate/computer-science-bs/faq/#check104] to determine whether your previous programming experience is equivalent to CMSC 104.",General Information,NULL,NULL,Undergraduate Student
"I took a computer class in high school/community college, is it equivalent to CMSC 201?","You can only “place out” of CMSC 201 if you took the AP CS A exam and scored a 5, or if you have taken a college course that transfers as equivalent to CMSC 201.  If you want to have a course evaluated for transfer equivalency, you will need to submit it through the registrar’s office.  Whether it will transfer depends on what was covered in the class and the difficulty of the programming assignments. Consult the “CMSC 201 Checklist” [https://www.csee.umbc.edu/undergraduate/computer-science-bs/faq/#check201]. If the course did not cover all of this material at a rigorous level, it will not transfer as equivalent to CMSC 201. Note also that programming projects for most of the computer science courses, including CMSC 104, 201, 202 and 341, are assigned on UMBC’s GL systems, which run the Linux operating system.  Therefore, the ability to edit, compile and debug programs using a command-line interface with Linux (or some other variant of UNIX) is very important for students who are intending to move directly into CMSC 202 or 341.  If you have not had this experience, you will need to be prepared to learn Linux very quickly if you are entering directly into one of these classes.

I just found out that I got a “C” in CMSC 201 and I am under the gateway requirements for computer science majors. What should I do?,"You must repeat CMSC 201 at UMBC and receive a grade of “B” or higher, if you wish to remain a computer science major. You should do so during the next regular semester (Spring or Fall). Note that the UMBC undergraduate catalog states that:

… you may not repeat a course for a higher grade once you have successfully completed any subsequent course of a higher level in an academic sequence (for example, you may not retake FREN 101 after successfully completing FREN 102).

CMSC 201 and 202 are considered an academic sequence.

Note: If you do not pass the gateway requirements, you will not be allowed to graduate even if you have otherwise satisfied the requirements of the major. To pass the gateway, the students must complete CMSC 201 and CMSC 202 (minimum grade of “B” required) and CMSC 203 (minimum grade of “C” required)",General Information,NULL,NULL,Undergraduate Student

I’m currently a freshman at a different college/university and I plan to transfer to UMBC as a computer science major in the next year or two. Which courses should I take now?,"Let’s start with what you should not do. You should not plan to just take the courses to satisfy the general requirements at your current institution and then take all the technical courses at UMBC. If you do so, you should not expect to take much less than four years at UMBC to complete a BS in computer science.

For computer science majors, your goal should be to prepare yourself to take CMSC 341 (Data Structures) at UMBC as soon as possible. This means that you should complete the Computer Science I & II sequence (CSI&II) at your current institution. The general advice is that you should take both CSI and CSII at your current institution. Articulation meetings of 2-year colleges and 4-year universities in Maryland (sponsored by the University System of Maryland) have found general agreement on the topics that should be covered in CSI&II, but little agreement on which course should cover which topics. Thus, if you only take CSI at your current institution, your transfer evaluation becomes complicated. The alternative is to take both CSI&II at UMBC, but doing so would probably mean that you will need four years at UMBC to complete a computer science major.

Note that all computer science majors must complete the gateway, as well as complete all the prerequisites for CMSC 341 before registering for CMSC 341. The gateway requires students to have a grade of “B” or better in both CSI&II. Although the letter grade at another institution does not count toward your GPA at UMBC, we will only accept a grade of “B” or better at another institution for the gateway requirements. If you have a grade of “C” or lower for CSI&II, then you must repeat the sequence either at your current institution or at UMBC.  (Note that you may not take CSI or CSII more than twice and remain eligible to major in CS at UMBC.  Third-time retakes of these classes are not permitted.)

Another prerequisite for CMSC 341 (Data Structures) is CMSC 203 (Discrete Structures). This is a mathematics course that teaches computer science majors about truth tables, Boolean algebra, proof by induction, etc. The discrete structures course may be taught out of the math department or the computer science department. You should take a course in discrete structures at your institution, if such a course is available.

Note that most of the programming projects for computer science courses at UMBC will use a UNIX operating system (e.g., Linux). If you have not used UNIX or one of its variants before, then you should familiarize yourself with the UNIX command-line interface, a text editor (e.g., vi, emacs). This will save you the trouble of having to learn UNIX as you are completing your first programming project at a new environment.

Other courses that will help you complete a BS in computer science in a timely fashion include: Calculus I&II, science courses and English composition. Note that as of Fall 2000, computer science majors must take a 1-year sequence in Biology, Chemistry or Physics. This sequence of courses must be designed for science and engineering majors. At UMBC, these sequences are BIOL 141+142 (BIOL 100+301 are being phased out), PHYS 121+122, and CHEM 101+102. Furthermore, the University requirements include a science laboratory course. It will be helpful if you arrive at UMBC having completed the calculus and science requirements.

On the other hand, there are some computer courses that do not help you graduate anytime sooner including: internet “fundamentals”, lower-level database courses, lower-level networking courses, programming courses other than CSI&II. These courses can contribute to your general understanding of computer science and might transfer to UMBC as an elective, but they will not count toward the BS degree requirements in computer science.",General Information,NULL,NULL,Prospective Student

How to request a GRE Waiver?,"Computer Science applicants, please read the following FAQ before applying for the CS GRE Waiver. (Link to form provided below)
Q1: Why does the Computer Science Graduate program require the GRE for admission?
A: We receive applications from all over the world, often from unfamiliar universities. The GRE scores are standardized data that allows us to compare applicants with very different backgrounds.
Q2: What is the cutoff for GRE scores?
A: There is no official cutoff for GRE scores. However, admission is competitive, so all other things being equal, the applicant with higher scores has the advantage. For your reference, the top 64 applicants for the Fall 2009 semester had average GRE scores of 544 Verbal, 756 Math and 3.97 Analytic.
Q3: Can I apply for a GRE waiver?
A: Some applicants may request waivers. See the GRE Waiver Request Form for detailed instructions. Note that applicants seeking financial support must have GRE scores. Also, qualifying for a GRE Waiver Request does not imply that your request will be automatically approved. Your request will be approved only if the computer science graduate admissions committee agrees that GRE scores are not needed to make an admissions decision in your case.
Q4: Why is the deadline for requesting a GRE Waiver so early? What if I send in a request after the deadline?
A: The deadlines are early enough so that if your request if denied, then you would still have time to take the GRE. If you send in a request after the deadline and your request is denied, then you will have to defer your application.

Please complete the CS GRE waiver request form: [https://www.csee.umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/659/2022/05/CS_GRE_Waiver_Request.pdf] or the CE/EE GRE waiver request form: [https://www.csee.umbc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/659/2022/05/GRE-Waiver-Form.pdf].

"I have a degree in a field not related to CS, but have some experience with computers. Can I be admitted to the MS program in CS?","An applicant who has not completed substantially all of the courses listed in response to the previous question will generally not be accepted as a degree-seeking student in our graduate program. However, such a student is invited to take these courses as a “special student” and to reapply after taking them.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student
What is a “special or non-degree seeking” student?,"A “special student” or “non-degree-seeking student” is not in any degree-granting program. Special students may take courses for credit; however, there are significant restrictions as to how many credit hours taken as a special student may transfer toward a degree program, if the student subsequently gains admission as a degree-seeking student. For details, see the catalog. To be admitted as a special student, there are two requirements: grade point average of at least 3.0, and–for students who graduate from foreign institutions–a TOEFL score of at least 213 (on the computerized test). GREs are not required for special students.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student
I wish to be considered for financial support — What should I do ? I have been accepted into the MS or PhD program but I was not offered financial support. What are my chances for obtaining support? Should I do anything to increase my chances of obtaining support?,"The department has a vigorous, externally funded research program, and each year we support a large number of students as TAs and RAs. Checking the box for financial support on your application for admission automatically puts you in consideration for all available support. You do not have to do anything else. Be sure you have your application and supporting materials in before the deadline (January 1 for fall admission).Each year, the top applicants are identified by the admissions committee as candidates for support through TAs or Fellowships. Like decisions for admission, these decisions are also made based on your undergraduate record, test scores, letters of support etc. Although priority is given to PhD students, well-qualified MS students also receive support. Any available support is offered to these applicants. The department typically makes initial offers to incoming students in early March. This offer is included with the letter of admission from the department. For applications that are received or completed late, decisions on financial support are made on a rolling basis, as and when positions become available. Often no positions are available for late applications. Note that while we support a large majority of our full-time students, not all students who have requested financial assistantship can be supported.If you do not recieve support before coming to UMBC, please realize that your chances of subsequently obtaining departmental support are very small. While you may have heard anecdotal stories of students who join the program unsupported later obtaining support, these things happen rarely. International students who come unsupported should in particular plan to be able to support their tuition and living expenses for the duration of their studies since INS regulations prevent them from working while on student visas.Please do not email faculty members with your resumes asking them to evaluate your chances of receiving support — realize that your chances depend on the strength of your application as well as the strength of the other applicants in the pool. No faculty member can evaluate your chances based on your email alone, no matter how much details you enclose.Research assistantships are outside the purview of the admissions committee. RAs are selected by the sponsoring faculty member, from the pool of all current and admitted students. Strong applicants who are seeking research assistantships are encouraged to contact faculty members directly by email. Please do not indiscriminately send email to all faculty professing an interest in their research, though. Faculty do talk to each other about prospective students, and a mass mailing is likely to reduce your chances of getting support. Go through our web page, identify those professors whose research interests you, and then contact them.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student
I submitted an application without the application fee. Will my application be reviewed?,"No. The admissions committee will never see or even know about your application. The Graduate School witholds from the Department all applications submitted without the mandatory application fee. Every year, hundreds of applicants fail to understand this rule. In extreme hardship cases, the applicant may petition the Graduate School to waive the required fee. Such waivers are rarely granted. We understand that for some people a $50 application fee is a tremendous barrier. On the other hand, reviewing each application costs UMBC more than $50, and University policy prevents us from reviewing applications without the fee.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student
"I have applied or I have been admitted, but I would like to delay my matriculation. May I do so, and if so, what should I do?","To delay matriculation, you must submit a request in writing to the department. Such requests are typically granted, but only once and only for up to one year. After one year, or on the second such request, a new application must be submitted, with an additional application fee. Please note that offers for financial support will not be carried over, nor will applications which delay matriculation be considered anew for support.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student

I am currently enrolled in an MS degree program at CSEE. How do I apply for the Ph.D. program?,"You need to submit a new application to the department. Since you are an “internal” applicant, your application does not need to be sent to the Graduate School and you do NOT have to pay a fee. Do NOT use the online system to apply since it will require payment. Simply print out the application form and complete it and submit it to the Graduate Program Coordinator at the department. You must, submit the following documents along with your application: new statement of purpose, and at least three new letters of recommendation from UMBC faculty, an unofficial copy of your most recent transcript. Preferably, these new letters should come from regular faculty who know you well, including your research advisor and any professors with whom you intend to work. In your new statement of purpose, you should explain why you wish to change status, and you should discuss what research you plan to undertake and with whom you intend to carry out this research.",Graduate General Information,NULL,NULL,Graduate Student

What does UMBC stand for?,"The acronym UMBC stands for The University of Maryland Baltimore County. Founded in 1966, UMBC is a campus of the University of Maryland System specializing in science and technology.
